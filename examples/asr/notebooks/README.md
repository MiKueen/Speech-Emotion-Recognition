ASR Tutorial Notebooks
----------------------
Tutorials for the `nemo_asr` collection are stored here.

The introduction covers the basics of end-to-end automatic speech recognition, and how to get started with ASR using NeMo.
We recommend that you start with that if you are either new to ASR, or new to NeMo.

You should be able to import these Jupyter notebooks from Google Colab by using the "Upload from GitHub" option.
